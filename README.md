# PortfolioSource
This repository features the source code stripped from the cross platform code, which can be discussed in private if needed. All projects can build and run, though some will need to have their debugging directory in the vs settings to be changed to the outputdir.

All projects have been built and tested on a Windows device using vs2019 with SDK: 10.0.20348.0.

## Dataflow:

### Note: In order to build make sure to set the "TDGame" project as startup project.

## Thorium:
www.tomlemmers.com/ProjectPages/Thorium.html
### Note: Doesn't run from within the editor, unless the debugging environment is changed to $(OutDir)

## CPU raytracer:
www.tomlemmers.com/ProjectPages/CPURaytracer.html
HDRI maps have been removed due to LFS budget.
### Note: Creates the image in the project directory when ran from visual studio.
