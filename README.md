# PortfolioSource
This repository features the source code stripped from the cross platform code, which can be discussed in private if needed. All projects can build and run, though some will need to have their debugging directory in the vs settings to be changed to the outputdir.

All projects have been built and tested on a Windows device using vs2019 with SDK: 10.0.20348.0.
